# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to quantify weather data for a fictional business venture on Oahu, Hawaii. The venture relates to tourism and surfing, and the success of the venture is dependent on the weather of the business location. A dataset was provided that offers weather information including temperatures and precipitation from different weather stations over a multi-year period. The information was extracted and summarized using SQLite.

The two deliverables were summary temperature statistics from the months of June and December, respectively, over the multi-year period captured by the data.
