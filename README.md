# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to quantify weather data for a fictional business venture on Oahu, Hawaii. The venture relates to tourism and surfing, and the success of the venture is dependent on the weather of the business location. A dataset was provided that offers weather information including temperatures and precipitation from different weather stations over a multi-year period. The information was extracted and summarized using SQLite.

The two deliverables were summary temperature statistics from the months of June and December, respectively, over the multi-year period captured by the data.

## Results

The major takeaways from the two deliverables included:

- The temperatures appear relatively constant year-round. The mean temperature recorded in June was 74.94 degrees F, and the mean temperature recorded in December was 71.04 degrees F. 
- The temperatures may to be warm enough to support surfing year-round. The minimum temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees F, and the maximum temperature recorded in December was 56 degrees F. 
- The temperatures do not vary much in a given month. For June, the interquartile range is 73-77 degrees F, and for December, the interquartile range is 69-74 degrees F. The standard deviation for June is 3.26, and the standard deviation for December is 3.75.
